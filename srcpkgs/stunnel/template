# REMARKS:
#
# What. A. Pain. What a total pain.
#
# Using the archive is the only way to get builds to keep working after
# the new version is out. LibreSSL patches for stunnel 5.35 don't yet
# work. Not enough is made conditional.
#
# --
#
# It is important to note that upstream has expressly refused to support
# LibreSSL.
#
# --
#
# Significant thanks to the OpenBSD project for creating patch sets
# for 5.37.
#
# One thing OpenBSD does that we don't do here is add a _stunnel
# user/group and modify the configuration samples to chroot and use this
# by default.
#
# As of 5.38 the signature expected for the CRYPTO_set_mem_functions
# seems to be out of line with what libressl provides.
#
# LibreSSL wants:
#
#     void (*)(void *)
#
# but argument is of type:
#
#     void (*)(void *, const char *, int)
#
# This is probably not a security problem. EDIT: Well, it would
# break. Badly.
#
# --
#
# As of 5.39_2 the code now doesn't use above function call if using
# LibreSSL, and a different call to `SSL_CTX_sess_set_get_cb` gets a
# `const unsigned char *` instead of an `unsigned char *`
#
# --
#
# As of 5.41_1 there are only two sorts of code warnings:
#
#     conversion 'long int' from 'long unsigned int'
#
# for what appear to be flags, and:
#
#     SSL_SESSION* (*)(struct ssl_st *, unsigned char *, int, int*) expected
#     got SSL_SESSION* (*)(struct ssl_st *, const unsigned char *, int, int*)
#
# These are not being considered issues.
